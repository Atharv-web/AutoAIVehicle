1. Due to lack of publically available datasets on in cabin environments, the video is a demonstration that consists of 3 simulated tasks - these tasks mimic the behavioural patterns of drivers that show seizure, panic attack, and heart attack.
2. The demonstration video also has a youtube video of a twitch streamer almost falling asleep while driving. This video is used as a simulation for real time analysis of the drivers state to test out the system.
3. For testing yourself, take any video that consists of monitoring of drivers, to detect what medical issues might occur.
